After creating the function, I tested it with the following script. 

spool test_script
set serveroutput on
set echo on
select square_root(-1) from dual;
select square_root(0) from dual;
select square_root(4,'blah') from dual;
select square_root(number_input=>5,debug_on=>'Y') from dual
/
select square_root(4) from dual
/
select square_root(6.25) from dual
/
select square_root(1000) from dual
/
select square_root(123456789) from dual
/
select square_root(987654321) from dual
/
spool off
